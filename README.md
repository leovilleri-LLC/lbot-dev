# lbot-dev
A bot for Google Chat, with multiple features.

This repository is only for issue reporting or feature requests for the HEAD development version of LBot, called "LBotDev".

If you do want to submit a bug report or feature request, you must use an issue template. If you do not, your feature request or bug report will be rejected (unless the bug is very critical).


This is **NOT** the official code for the LBot project. The code for the project is closed-source.
